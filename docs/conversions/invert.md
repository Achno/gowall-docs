# Invert Colors

### âž¤  `Singe conversion`

As the name suggests invert, inverts the colors of an image, ex. white --> black.

   ```bash
gowall invert path/to/img.png 
gowall invert path/to/img.png --output ~/NewFolder/newname.png
   ```

### Scenario where you want to use it
Lets say you just did `gowall convert ~/img.png -t catppuccin` and you were not satisfied by the theme conversion.
Invert helps you completely flip the colors of the original image and when you do `gowall convert ~/img.png -t catppuccin`
again the result will be entirely different.

Lets see an example so you can understand what i mean visually.

So we got an image we want to convert to the catppuccin theme, but the end result does not look like a catppuccin image.
Well the colors on the image use colors from the catppuccin color palette but where is the signature purple dark colors?
Lets fix that ðŸ”¨.

- Lets invert those colors and try converting to `catppuccin color scheme` again. Now after inverting the image we convert that image 
to a catppuccin theme and boom! looking good in my signature yellow-catpuccin theme :)

### âž¤  `Batch conversion`

```bash
gowall invert --batch img1.png,img2.png 
gowall invert --batch img1.png,img2.png --output ~/NewFolder
```

### âž¤  `Directory conversion`

```bash
gowall invert --dir ~/Pictures/Dir 
gowall invert --dir ~/Pictures/Dir --output ~/NewFolder
```
