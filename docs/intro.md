# Introduction (Important)

## What is gowall?

Gowall is a CLI and started as a way to convert images ( specifically wallpapers ) to your favourite color scheme ex. catppuccin,everforest,solarized ...  

Since then, Gowall has evolved significantly, and I‚Äôve transformed it into a versatile Swiss Army knife for a variety of cool image processing tasks.

## Image preview

Gowall  supports  `image preview`  by printing the image on the following terminals. 
- Kitty
- Ghostty ( `v.0.2.0` and up)
- Konsole ( `v.0.2.0` and up)
- Wezterm (Available in the main branch)

 All of the above (except Wezterm) require the <u>**kitten** binary </u> to be installed.The easiest way to get that binary is just by installing [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), once you have that you can use Image preview in any of the above terminals. If you are running on an <u>terminal emulator other the ones above</u> it will just **open your default image viewing application no matter the operating system**. 

`Image preview` is `ON` by default. You can disable it by adding the following inside your `~/.config/gowall/config.yml` 

   ```yaml title="~/.config/gowall/config.yml"
   EnableImagePreviewing: false
   ```
For Wezterm your `.wezterm.lua` config shoud have these options enabled : 
```lua
local wezterm = require 'wezterm'

local config = wezterm.config_builder()

config = {
  enable_kitty_keyboard = true,
  enable_kitty_graphics = true,  
}

return config
```

## Shell completions

### What are completions?

in cli's completions help you finish typing commands and their options (flags,subcommands) quickly by pressing `[TAB]`,for example 

```bash
gowall [TAB] 
```
would show you the options below

```
Available Commands:
  bg          Removes the background of the image
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  convert     Convert an img's color scheme
  draw        draw a border with a color and thickness (currently)
  extract     Returns the color pallete of the image you specificed (like pywal)
  help        Help about any command
  invert      Inverts the color's of an image
  list        Lists available themes
  pixelate    Turns an image to pixel art depending on the scale flag

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for gowall
  -t, --toggle    Help message for toggle
  -v, --version   show gowall version
  -w, --wall      fetches the wallpaper of the day!
```
<br />
### How do i add shell completions?

Shell completions are available for `zsh` `bash` `fish` `powershell`. Lets see how to add `zsh` shell completions, all the other can be added the same way.

Generate the completion and save it as `_gowall`
```bash
gowall completion zsh > ~/_gowall
```
Add the following  to your `.zshrc` to make sure zsh can use shell completions
```bash title=".zshrc"
fpath=(~/ $fpath)

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

Lastly source your `.zshrc`
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
